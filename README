This is my JavaScript experiment to generate Mandelbrot fractals using the HTML5 canvas and jQuery.
Click on the generated fractal image to zoom in

You can experiment with the various color algorithms to get different effects by uncommenting out their 
respective code blocks in the getColor() function (don't forget to comment out the one previously used).

The initate() function has variables to set image size and number of iterations to compute.

The formula to generate the Mandelbrot set is widely known.  This particular implementation was adapted from a 
BASIC program in the 1991 book: "Fractals: Endlessly Repeated Geometrical Figures (Princeton Science Library)"


Known issues (this is highly experimental and basically my second project in javascript): 

Zoom is slightly inaccurate by a few pixels, since the mouse position is relative to the start of
the page as opposed to the start of the canvas element.

It looks like the far right column of pixels is getting drawn on the far left of the image

Proposed Enhancements:

UI to input and display fractal parameters
Panning
Zoom out/go back
Add workers to increase performance
Optimize color algo
Put the different color algos in separate functions and make accessible in UI menu
